They are vulnerable to many anthropogenic stressors, such as habitat degradation, blocked access to spawning grounds, and loss of genetic diversity from hatcheries. A particularly concerning stressor for Chinook salmon are changes in freshwater thermal regimes due to simplification of the physical structure of aquatic systems, reduced shading from the removal of riparian vegetation, and altered flow regimes from climate change and water diversion. (Richter & Kolmes, 2005). In a study that investigated the effects of three temperature regimes on juvenile Chinook salmon growth, it was found that juveniles reared at an elevated temperature range of 21–24°C experienced significantly decreased growth rates compared with juveniles reared at 13–16°C (Marine & Cech Jr, 2004). Furthermore, studies have found that juvenile Chinook salmon length is positively correlated with the survival and survival was markedly low among the smallest length class (that is, 80 mm to 89 mm) of subyearling Chinook salmon (Brown, Oldenburg & Seaburg et al., 2013). As California’s Chinook salmon populations become increasingly threatened by changes in freshwater thermal regimes and with increasing evidence suggesting that juvenile Chinook Salmon survival could be negatively impacted by decreased fork length, it is necessary to understand how the size of out-migrating juvenile Chinook salmon in the San Francisco Estuary may be impacted by the water temperature of their native rivers.\nWhile previous studies have used controlled laboratory experiments to test the effects of water temperature on Chinook salmon growth, I will use a long-term fish monitoring dataset in my analysis to quantify the impact of water temperature on juvenile Chinook salmon fork length.\nData Description and Collection\nI downloaded Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) survey data from the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) Data Portal.\nInteragency Ecological Program survey data\nThe IEP survey data contains over four decades (1976-2021) of juvenile fish monitoring data from the San Francisco Estuary, collected by the The United States Fish and Wildlife Service Delta Juvenile Fish Monitoring Program (DJFMP). As part of the IEP that manages the San Francisco Estuary, the DJFMP has tracked the relative abundance and distribution of naturally and hatchery produced juvenile Chinook Salmon of all races as they out-migrate through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta using a combination of surface trawls and beach seines. Since 2000, three trawl sites and 58 beach seine sites have been sampled weekly or biweekly within the San Francisco Estuary and lower Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers.\nThe DJFMP data set contains columns of the sample site location, date, time, sample method, environmental conditions, water temp, species, fish count, and fork length. Each row represents a sample of one or multiple fish (must have the same fork length) at a distinct site and time. The strengths of this data set are that the sample size is very large and it has ample metadata. The limitations of this data set are that its samples were not taken continuously prior to 1995 so there are gaps in the data. After 1995 samples were taken year-round to the expand the temporal monitoring of fish. Also the data set is not already in tidy format because each row does not represent one fish. For example, the ‘Count’ column contains the count of fish with the same fork length per sample date, which should each be separate rows. The full metadata can be found here.\nThe variables that I am interested in for my analysis are fork length (mm) and water temperature (degrees Celsius).\nFork Length\nFork length is the length of sampled fish measured from the point of the mouth to the fork of the caudal fin. Fish were measured to the nearest 1 mm before being released. Generally, all fish in each sample that were ≥ 25 mm fork length were identified by species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Fork length of juvenile Chinook salmon in San Francisco Estuary from 1976 to 2021.\n\n\n\nWater Temperature\nThe YSI PRO 2030 Meter was used to measure water temperature before or after each fish sample. Water temperature was recorded to the nearest 0.1˚C.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Water Temperature at sample sites in San Francisco Estuary from 1976 to 2021.\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nI will conduct a hypothesis test to determine if there is a difference in the mean juvenile Chinook salmon fork length (mm) across sites with warmer or colder than average water temperatures in the San Francisco Estuary. Specifically, I will use a linear regression to see if water temperature affects fork length.\nFirst, I will define my null and alternative hypotheses. Second, I will collect and filter my data for location, sample date, fork length, water temperature, method code, and count. The data must be in tidy format so I will use the uncount() function to turn the ‘Count’ column into duplicate rows so that each row represents one observation. To clean the data I will drop NA values from the water temperature column and exclude any adult Chinook salmon samples by removing fork length values greater than 250mm. I will also remove all fork length values of zero mm because these are faulty samples that do not represent real fish. After visualizing the relationship between water temperature and fork length, I will calculate the mean water temperature across all samples and then filter for water temperatures above and below the mean water temperature. This method of subsetting should give a simple, unbiased\ndetermination of whether the sample is from a warmer or colder site. Then, I will take the mean fork length of the warm and cold sites and compute a point estimate of the difference between the mean fork length of juvenile Chinook salmon that are reared in warmer than average sites versus colder than average sites. Fourth, I will conduct a t-test to measure the variability of the sample statistic and ensure that my point estimate is just a difference in the samples due to random variability. Fifth, I will quantify the probability that the sample statistic differs from the null hypothesis by running a linear regression of water temperature on fork length. Finally, based on my p-value, I will reject or fail to reject my null hypothesis.\nLimitations\nA limitation of my analysis is that water temperature is the only independent variable included in the model, which means this analysis is vulnerable to omitted variables bias. It is very likely that there are many different abiotic and biotic factors in addition to water temperature that influence juvenile Chinook salmon fork length.\nHypotheses\nNull Hypothesis \\[H_{0}: \\mu_{ForkLengthCold} - \\mu_{ForkLengthWarm} = 0\\]\nAlternative hypothesis \\[H_{A}: \\mu_{ForkLengthCold} - \\mu_{ForkLengthWarm} \\neq 0\\]\nVisualize data\nScatter plot showing changes in juvenile Chinook salmon fork length (\\(y\\)-axis) as it relates to water temperature (\\(x\\)-axis).\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Juvenile Chinook salmon fork length as it relates to water temperature at sample sites in the San Francisco Estuary from 1976 to 2021.\n\n\n\nDensity plot of juvenile Chinook salmon fork length (\\(y\\)-axis) as it relates to water temperature (\\(x\\)-axis).\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The denity of juvenile Chinook salmon fork lengths as it relates to water temperature at sample sites in the San Francisco Estuary from 1976 to 2021.\n\n\n\nDensity plot with geom_bin2d() of juvenile Chinook salmon fork length (\\(y\\)-axis) as it relates to water temperature (\\(x\\)-axis).\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The denity of juvenile Chinook salmon fork length as it relates to water temperature at sample sites in the San Francisco Estuary from 1976 to 2021.\n\n\n\nResults\n\n[1] 7.057725\n\n\\[PointEstimate =  {MeanForkLengthWarm} - {MeanForkLengthCold}\\] The point estimate for the difference in mean fork lengths for warm water sites versus cold water sites is 7.057725 mm. However, this value could just be a difference in the samples due to random variability. Thus, I must calculate a measure of variability using a t-test.\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  DJFMP_CHN_df$ForkLength[DJFMP_CHN_df$WaterTemp > mean_water_temp_overall] and DJFMP_CHN_df$ForkLength[DJFMP_CHN_df$WaterTemp < mean_water_temp_overall]\nt = 118.53, df = 190196, p-value < 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 6.941016 7.174433\nsample estimates:\nmean of x mean of y \n 50.06559  43.00787 \n\nThe test statistic (z-score) tells us that the observed difference in the mean fork length for cold water and warm water sites is 118.53 standard deviations above the null hypothesis of zero difference.\nThe 95% confidence interval tells us that there is a 95% probability that the range [6.941016, 7.174433] is likely to contain the true population parameter, which is the difference in juvenile Chinook salmon mean fork lengths across sites with colder water temperatures versus sites with warmer water temperatures.\nThe high test statistic indicates that the distribution of the data might have a long tail due to outliers. We can visualize this by plotting the residuals.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: The distribution of residuals for water temperature on juvenile Chinook salmon fork length.\n\n\n\nThe residuals appear to be mean zero based on the histogram above, but there is a long right tail in the residuals distribution, so it is definitely not a perfectly normal distribution.\nNext I will quantify the probability that the sample statistic differs from the null by using the lm() command to estimate the following simple linear regression:\n\\[ \\text{fork length}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{water temperature}_i + \\varepsilon_i \\]\n\nTable 1: Table 1: Linear Regression of Water Temperature on Juvenile Chinook Salmon Fork Length\n\nEstimate\nStd.

This is a relatively large amount of variation explained by just water temperature, which proves that water temperature does play a significant role in determining the fork length of juvenile Chinook salmon.\n\n\n\nFigure 7: A linear regression of the relationship between water temperature and juvenile Chinook salmon fork length in the San Francisco Estuary from 1976 to 2021.\n\n\n\nWe can see the increase in juvenile Chinook salmon fork lengths as the water temperature increases from our linear regression line.\nSince \\(p-value = 2.2e-16 < 0.05\\) we reject the null that there is no difference in the mean juvenile Chinook salmon fork length at sites with colder water temperatures versus sites with warmer water temperatures. We can say there is a statistically significant difference (at the 5% significance level) in the juvenile Chinook salmon mean fork length across sites with colder water temperatures versus sites with warmer water temperatures.\nConclusion and Next Steps\nBased on the findings of my analysis, the mean fork length of juvenile Chinook salmon in the San Francisco Estuary does significantly differ at sample sites with colder water temperatures compared to warmer water temperatures. The p-value from my linear regression was small enough to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the mean juvenile Chinook salmon fork length at sites with colder water temperatures versus sites with warmer water temperatures.\nIn future analyses, I would investigate the difference the mean fork length of juvenile Chinook salmon at sites with high nutrient levels versus sites with low nutrient levels. Nutrient levels play a key role in determining the growth rate of juvenile Chinook salmon because insects and other food sources are often more abundant in rivers with warmer water water temperatures than colder water temperatures. Additionally, using a multiple linear regression to investigate the role that nutrient levels and water temperature have on the mean fork length of juvenile Chinook salmon could provide valuable information for the conservation and management of this threatened species.\nGithub\nThe repository containing all of the code and data for this analysis can be found here.\nReferences\nInteragency Ecological Program (IEP), R.
